# 🌐🔌📡 Networking Project

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on **computer networking design and simulation** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It includes the design of a network topology, IP addressing scheme, routing configuration, and testing connectivity.

---

## 📊 Features
- **Network Topology**
  - Designed LAN/WAN with routers, switches, and PCs.
- **IP Addressing**
  - Implemented subnetting for efficient IP usage.
- **Routing Protocols**
  - Configured static routing and dynamic routing (RIP/OSPF).
- **Connectivity Testing**
  - Verified end-to-end communication using `ping` and simulation mode.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🌐 How to design efficient network topologies.  
- 🔌 Configuring routers and switches in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- 📡 Implementing static and dynamic routing.  
- ⚡ Troubleshooting connectivity issues.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- **Networking Devices (Routers, Switches, PCs)**  
- **Routing Protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)**  

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- ✅ Network topology designed and tested successfully with full connectivity.  
- ✅ Routing protocols implemented with correct convergence.  
- ⚠️ Current design is limited to simulation.  
- 🔍 Next Step: implement in **GNS3 or real hardware**, and test **QoS, VLANs, ACLs, and security policies**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Load the project file (`network_project.pkt`).  
3. Test connectivity between devices using the simulation mode.
