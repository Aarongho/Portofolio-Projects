# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on **classifying heart disease** using clinical datasets.  
The workflow includes **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation** to assess prediction performance.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🔑 Performed EDA to uncover correlations and data insights  
- 📌 Handled multicollinearity and scaling features before training  
- 🚀 Built and evaluated classification models with real-world data  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **Statsmodels**

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- ✅ The models achieved good baseline accuracy.  
- 🔍 Next step: experiment with **ensemble models** (RandomForest, XGBoost) and apply **hyperparameter tuning** to improve generalization.
