# 📊🎨🧩 Obesity Data Visualization with R

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on **visualizing obesity and lifestyle datasets** using R.  
The dataset (*Obesity Levels & Lifestyle*) contains demographic and lifestyle factors from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.  
The goal is to create **clear, interpretable, and aesthetic visualizations** to better understand obesity patterns.

## 📊 Visualization & Approach
- **Data Preparation**
  - Cleaned demographic and lifestyle features
  - Handled categorical and numerical variables
- **Visualizations**
  - Distribution plots of BMI, weight, height, and activity levels
  - Correlation heatmaps between lifestyle factors
  - Comparative bar charts for obesity vs non-obesity groups
  - Faceted scatterplots for age, gender, and lifestyle
- **Design Choices**
  - Used **ggplot2** with minimal themes
  - Applied color palettes for readability
  - Combined multiple plots into dashboards with `patchwork`

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 📊 Effective storytelling with R visualizations  
- 🎨 Designing clean, readable charts for health data  
- 🧩 Combining multiple plots to form cohesive dashboards  
- ⚡ How visualizations highlight imbalance and feature relationships  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **R**
- **ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr**
- **gridExtra, patchwork**
- **ggthemes**

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- ✅ Current visualizations highlight **distributions, correlations, and group comparisons** clearly.  
- ⚠️ Limitations: purely exploratory; does not include predictive modeling.  
- 🔍 Next Step: add **interactive dashboards** (e.g., Shiny, Plotly for R) to allow filtering by demographic group.
