# 🌍🏙️📊 European City Analysis (Tableau)

## 📂 Project Overview
This Tableau project visualizes the **distribution of cities in Europe** across countries.  
It highlights geographic patterns, average latitude by country, and the number of cities per country.

---

## 📊 Visualization & Insights
- **Geographic Distribution**
  - Map view showing spatial spread of cities across European countries.
- **Average Latitude**
  - Bar chart comparing geographic positions of cities by country.
- **Number of Cities**
  - Pie chart summarizing city counts per country, highlighting top contributors (e.g., Turkey, France, Germany).

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🌍 How to combine maps and charts into a multi-view Tableau dashboard.  
- 📊 Using color-coded pie charts to emphasize country-level contributions.  
- 🧠 Identifying geographic distribution patterns across Europe.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Tableau**
- **Excel / CSV dataset of European cities**

---

## 📌 Evaluation
- ✅ The dashboard clearly shows disparities in the number of cities represented by each country (Turkey and France dominate, while smaller countries have minimal representation).  
- ✅ The latitude comparison adds geographic context to city distributions.  
- ⚠️ Limitation: dataset only reflects included cities, not necessarily all cities in each country.  
- 🔍 Next Step: expand dataset to include population size or economic indicators for richer analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.  
2. Load the dataset into Tableau.  
3. Open the workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`).  
4. Explore the interactive dashboard.
