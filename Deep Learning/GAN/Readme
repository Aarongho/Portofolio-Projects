# 🌰🤖🎨 GAN for Pistachio Image Generation

## 📂 Project Overview
This project builds a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate synthetic pistachio images.  
The goal is to augment limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples for further training or experimentation.

---

## 🤖 Model & Approach
- **GAN Architecture**
  - Generator: creates synthetic pistachio images from random noise
  - Discriminator: distinguishes between real and generated images
  - Trained adversarially to improve image realism
- **Evaluation**
  - Used **InceptionV3**-based embeddings and **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** to evaluate realism
- **Tuning**
  - Hyperparameter search with Keras Tuner
  - Applied EarlyStopping to avoid mode collapse

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🌰 How GANs can generate synthetic agricultural image data  
- 🔎 Importance of balancing generator and discriminator during training  
- ⚡ Evaluation using FID for generative quality assessment  
- 🚀 Hands-on experience with Keras, InceptionV3, and adversarial training loops  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV, PIL**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Keras Tuner**
- **InceptionV3 (for FID evaluation)**

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- 📉 **Baseline:** Initial generator created blurry and unrealistic pistachio images due to unstable training.  
- ✅ **Improved Model:** With tuning and careful discriminator updates, generated images became sharper, and FID scores decreased, indicating improved realism.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations:** GAN still struggles with diversity and may repeat similar patterns.  
- 🔍 **Next Step:** Experiment with **DCGAN or Wasserstein GAN**, apply **data augmentation** during training, and test **conditional GANs** for class-specific pistachio image generation.
