# 🖼️✨ Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## 📂 Project Overview
This project builds an **autoencoder deep learning model** to clean noisy images.  
Because real-world noisy datasets were limited, synthetic noisy images were generated by adding random pixel noise, then used to train and evaluate the model.

## 🤖 Model & Approach
- **Autoencoder (Convolutional Neural Network)**
  - Encoder: stacked Conv2D + MaxPooling layers to compress image representation
  - Decoder: UpSampling + Conv2D layers to reconstruct clean images
  - Applied Dropout for regularization and stability
- **Noise Generation**
  - Artificial Gaussian/random noise was added to images for training
- **Tuning**
  - Used Keras Tuner to search hyperparameters (filters, kernel sizes, dropout rate)
  - EarlyStopping callback to avoid overfitting

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🖼️ How to generate synthetic noisy image datasets  
- 🔎 Implemented CNN-based autoencoder architecture for image restoration  
- ⚡ Importance of scaling, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning for better reconstructions  
- 🚀 How autoencoders can be applied to real-world denoising problems

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV, PIL**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Keras Tuner**
- **tqdm** (for progress tracking)

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- 📉 **Baseline:** Initial autoencoder without tuning showed blurred reconstructions due to underfitting.  
- ✅ **Tuned Model:** After Keras Tuner optimization and Dropout, reconstructions were sharper and MSE decreased significantly, proving the model effectively removed synthetic noise.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations:** Model trained on synthetic noise; real-world noise may be more complex.  
- 🔍 **Next Step:** Train with real noisy datasets (e.g., low-light photos), experiment with **denoising autoencoders + perceptual loss**, or test advanced architectures like **U-Net** for better edge preservation.
