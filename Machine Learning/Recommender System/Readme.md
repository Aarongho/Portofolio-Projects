# 🎮📊🤖 Game Recommender System

## 📂 Project Overview
This project builds a **content-based recommender system** for video games.  
The system suggests games to users based on similarity of descriptions and metadata.

---

## 🤖 Model & Approach
- **Preprocessing**
  - Extracted game descriptions and metadata
  - Converted text data into vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- **Similarity Calculation**
  - Cosine similarity and linear kernel applied to compute similarity between games
- **Recommendation**
  - Returns top-N similar games for any given input game

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 🎮 How to design a recommender system with minimal data  
- 📊 Importance of vectorization (TF-IDF) for text-based recommendations  
- 🤖 Using cosine similarity to compute similarity scores  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)**

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- 📉 **Baseline:** Simple random or popularity-based recommendations.  
- ✅ **Improved Model:** TF-IDF + cosine similarity gave more personalized results.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations:** Content-based filtering cannot suggest items outside user history.  
- 🔍 **Next Step:** Extend system with **collaborative filtering** or **hybrid methods** to improve diversity and novelty of recommendations.
