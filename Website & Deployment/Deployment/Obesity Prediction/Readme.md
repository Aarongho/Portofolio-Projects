# ⚕️🤖🚀 Obesity Prediction – ML Deployment

## 📂 Project Overview
This project develops and deploys a **machine learning pipeline** to predict obesity categories based on personal, dietary, and lifestyle information.  
The end product is a **Flask web app** where users can input their data and instantly get a prediction, along with feature importance visualization.

---

## 🔄 Pipeline & Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled categorical and numerical features
   - Scaling and encoding applied consistently

2. **Model Training**
   - Machine learning classifiers trained (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Best model saved with `joblib`

3. **Deployment**
   - Flask app integrates trained model into a web form
   - Displays predictions, probabilities, and feature importance
   - Deployed via GitHub + Live Demo (Heroku/Render)

## 🎯 What I Learned
- ⚕️ How to prepare lifestyle and health data for obesity prediction  
- 🤖 Building a complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to prediction  
- 🚀 Deploying ML models with Flask and connecting them to a web interface  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Flask**
- **Joblib (model serialization)**

---

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- ✅ Model deployment works and predictions are interactive.  
- ✅ Feature importance improves explainability for end users.  
- ⚠️ Current dataset is limited; may not capture global demographics.  
- 🔍 Next Step: improve with **larger dataset**, add **user authentication**, and test deep learning methods for higher accuracy.
