# 🥑 Avocado Price Forecasting

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on **forecasting avocado prices** using time series analysis and deep learning models.  
It includes decomposition of seasonal patterns, statistical stationarity tests, feature scaling, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 🤖 Model & Comparison
- **Classical Time Series Analysis**
  - Seasonal decomposition (STL), ACF/PACF, and ADF test were applied to analyze seasonality and stationarity.
  - Showed that avocado prices follow clear seasonal cycles.

- **Neural Network Model (TensorFlow/Keras)**
  - Sequential neural network trained on scaled features.
  - Evaluated with **MSE, MAE, and R² score**.
  - Outperformed simple baselines in capturing seasonal price trends.

- **Tuning (Keras Tuner)**
  - Hyperparameter tuning for layers, neurons, and learning rate.
  - Significantly reduced error metrics compared to the untuned model.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- 📊 How to decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.  
- 🔎 Applied statistical tests (ADF) and correlation analysis (ACF, PACF).  
- 🛠 Used RobustScaler to stabilize training and reduce outlier effects.  
- 🚀 Hyperparameter tuning improves forecasting performance significantly.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Keras Tuner**

## 📌 Evaluation / Next Step
- 📉 **Baseline Understanding:** Time series decomposition proved that avocado prices are highly seasonal, which explains why naive linear models struggle.  
- ✅ **Model Performance:** The tuned Keras model achieved **lower MSE/MAE** and higher **R²**, showing stronger predictive power. Improvements came from scaling and hyperparameter optimization.  
- ⚠️ **Limitations:** Model performance decreases during sudden market shifts (e.g., demand spikes or anomalies).  
- 🔍 **Next Step:** Explore **LSTM/GRU architectures** for sequence modeling, implement **rolling forecasts**, and combine statistical + ML methods (hybrid ARIMA + NN).
